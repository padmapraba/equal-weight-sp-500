# equal-weight-sp-500

The python script takes in a portfolio value and tells you how many shares of each stock to buy from the S&P 500.
This project implements API calls to EX_CLOUD_API to get the market capitalization and price of each stock in the S&P 500.
A sandbox version of the API is used, resulting in random values for the metrics.
